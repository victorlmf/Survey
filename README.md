This is a Flask application that accepts a form submission and presents the submitted data on a results page. 

This project demonstrates my skill of sending POST requests through a form and displaying that information. 

This Flask applicaiton will have the following criteria: 
- http://localhost:5000 - have this display a nice looking HTML form.  The form should be submitted to '/process'
- Save form data into session.
- http://localhost:5000/result - have this display a html with the information that was submitted by POST.
